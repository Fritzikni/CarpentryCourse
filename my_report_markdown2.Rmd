I can change the file
here
in github as well
---
title: "gapminder-report"
author: "Fritzi"
date: "January 16, 2019"
output: github_document
---
The output file can also be in github format. Choose output: github_document 
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# Load the data, insert R chunk using ctrl alt i
First, we are going to use read.csv to load the gapminder data.


```{r}
dat <- read.csv("data_R/gapminder_data.csv")
summary(dat)
```

# Plot data

## Setup

We need to load the ggplot2 package
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

## Plotting

```{r}
ggplot(data = dat,
       mapping = aes(x = year,
                     y = lifeExp,
                     by = country,
                     color = continent)) +
  facet_wrap(~ continent) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_bw()
```

## Insert premade figure


We have a figure at "figures/life_exp.png". How do we insert it into our report?

```{r, fig.cap = "Life expectancy vs, Year, for each country facetted by continent"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/life_exp.png")
```
